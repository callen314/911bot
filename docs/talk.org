* 911bot - The story

** What happened
   #+ATTR_HTML: :height 500px
   [[./mattsemail.png]]

** Main issue: delay in contacting emergency services

* The predictably nerdy response 

** 911bot is born
   [[./911bot_born.png]]
   [[./911botdev.png]]

** OK it's getting serious
   [[./mvp_stories.png]]

** And... It's official
   [[./github.png]]

** A team effort

* Minimum Viable Product
  + Store contact info through Slack securely
  + Access information through Slack in an emergency
  + Detect who has accessed emergency information
  + Fallback access options in case 911bot is down

** Basic usage
   [[./usage.png]]

* DevOps

** Design
   [[../deployment.png]]

** Implementation 

   + Docker + Kubernetes
   + Built on http://quay.io
 
*** Docker config

    #+CAPTION: @cwspear
    #+INCLUDE: "../Dockerfile" src dockerfile
    Fallback: all information is stored on a persistent Kubernetes volume, in a
    text file under the ~/contacts~ directory
*** Kubernetes
   
    #+CAPTION: @jmartin2 and @shrabok
    [[./classified.jpg]]
    + Secret API token
    + Persistent storage
    + Health check (WIP)

* Development

** Design (Emergency example)

   #+CAPTION: The sequence of messaging is intended to get the information to the requesting user as soon as possible
   [[../dynamic_emergency.png]]

** Implementation (Emergency example)

   #+INCLUDE: "../bot/plugins.py" src python :lines "70-85" 

** Implementation (DataStore)
   #+INCLUDE: ../bot/store.py src python :lines "11-14"
   #+INCLUDE: ../bot/store.py src python :lines "15-27"

** Implementation (DataStore)
   #+INCLUDE: ../bot/store.py src python :lines "28-40"
** A bit about the technology

   + Bot uses Slack's Real-Time Messaging (RTM) API
     + WebSockets using JSON as a payload format
   + Health check uses Slack's HTTP RPC API
     + Why? The RTM API is a PITA

* Testing 

  + A full top to bottom test is included as part of ~run_healthcheck.py~
  + This will run all the time to ensure the bot is operational and functioning
    as intended

* Status

  + The bot is stable
  + The data is as secure as other Surge services (JIRA, etc)
  + Additionally, the bot informs the target user if someone attempts to access
    the information through the bot

* Your turn

  + Add your info (let's hope we never have to access it!)
    + ~@911bot store-contact <local contact, local pd, address>~
  + Try and break it
    + ~@911bot yes~

  
** Actually...
   [[./live.gif]]

   + Start DMing the bot (@911bot)
   + Make it a party
   + Don't request someone else's info unless you have their agreement
     + Feel free to request mine (@ssomani)
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Do it yourself in Slack
   #+END_NOTES 

** So... what broke?

  + Do you really not have any unit tests?
